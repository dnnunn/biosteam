You’re describing exactly what most robust models eventually need: a **machine-readable contract** between “assumptions (inputs)” and “calculations (outputs).” You already have a great spine—the 9-column table. Let’s make it computationally explicit with **two lightweight add-ons** that keep Excel friendly but DAG-clean (Directed Acyclic Graph = no circulars) and easy to export to Python/BioSTEAM.

Here’s the minimal, scalable pattern:

## 1) Data Dictionary (extend your 9-col table by 2–3 columns)

Add these columns to your existing table (don’t change the nine; just append):

- **Key** — a canonical, machine-safe ID (snake_case). Example: `seed_media_cost_per_l_s3`
- **Type** — `input | calc | constant` (helps validation & UI)
- **Depends_On** — comma-separated list of Keys this row’s Formula references (leave blank for inputs/constants)

Your row still carries human labels (“Parameter Name”, “Description”) for readability; the **Key** is the unambiguous handle everywhere else.

Example (one input, one calc):

```
Parameter Name: USP01_Media_cost_per_L_S3
Formula:        =IF(USP01a_use_USP02_media, USP02_media_cost_per_L, 2.2)
Unit:           $/L
...
Key:            usp01_media_cost_per_l_s3
Type:           calc
Depends_On:     usp01a_use_usp02_media, usp02_media_cost_per_l
```

## 2) Calculation Graph (DSM = Design Structure Matrix)

Make a new sheet **DSM** that is literally a 0/1 matrix of dependencies:

- Rows = calc Keys
- Columns = all Keys (inputs + calcs)
- Cell is `1` if the row depends on the column

This is your “matrix encoding.” It’s auditable at a glance (banded upper-triangular if acyclic), sortable (topological order), and trivially exportable.

How to populate without pain:

- Use the **Depends_On** list you added to each calculation row.
- In DSM!B2, a formula like `=--ISNUMBER(SEARCH("," & DSM$A$1 & "," , "," & INDEX(Params!Depends_On, MATCH(DSM!$A2, Params!Key,0)) & ","))`
- Fill across/down to paint the adjacency matrix.

Result: you have a computationally accessible **DAG** inside Excel.

## 3) A tiny expression dialect (no new engine needed)

Keep Excel doing the math, but constrain formulas to **refer only by Key** (named ranges), not by A1 cells or display names. That gives you two powers:

- **Swap front-ends** (rename a parameter for people, keep the Key stable)
- **Serialize** the model (export Keys, Defaults, Units, Depends_On, Formula text)

If some rows still need A1 references, define a Name per Key (`Formulas » Name Manager`), point it at the correct cell, and use the Name in the formula. Now your sheet is a graph of Names, not coordinates.

## 4) Export is trivial (Power Query or Python)

With Keys + Depends_On you can:

- Export the **Parameters** sheet as JSON/CSV: a clean parameter registry
- Export the **DSM** sheet as a sparse edge list (rowKey → depKey)
- In Python, topologically sort the graph and evaluate (or just read back the computed Excel values)

A tiny JSON example your pipeline can read:

```
{
  "parameters": [
    {"key":"v_prod_working","type":"input","unit":"L","value":100000},
    {"key":"inoc_ratio_prod","type":"input","unit":"v/v","value":0.02},
    {"key":"usp01_media_cost_per_l_s3","type":"calc","unit":"$/L",
     "depends_on":["usp01a_use_usp02_media","usp02_media_cost_per_l"],
     "excel_formula":"=IF(USP01a_use_USP02_media, USP02_media_cost_per_L, 2.2)"},
    {"key":"seed_train_total_cost_usd","type":"calc","unit":"$",
     "depends_on":["seed_media_cost_total_usd","seed_steam_cost_usd","seed_labor_cost_usd"]}
  ]
}
```

## 5) Why this solves your communication gap

- **Descriptively encoded**: your descriptors (names, modules, options) stay for humans; the **Key** is the codec for machines.
- **Decoding is automatic**: Depends_On + DSM is a translation layer “in and out” of the dataset—exactly the matrix you had in mind.
- **Audit-friendly**: you can filter calcs by Type, show their Depends_On lists, and visually confirm the banded DSM (no circulars, or see exactly where).
- **No bloat**: you added 2–3 columns and one optional matrix sheet. The math is still simple Excel.

## 6) Concrete next steps in your workbook

1. Append **Key**, **Type**, **Depends_On** columns to your 9-col parameter table.
2. For each input row, set `Type = input`, leave Depends_On blank.
3. For each calculation row:
   - Convert its references to **Keys** (use Names if needed).
   - Fill Depends_On with those Keys (comma separated).
4. Build the **DSM** sheet as above (or skip if you don’t want the visual—Depends_On is enough for export).
5. (Optional) Add a small **“Health”** pivot: count calcs with missing Depends_On, or dependencies on unknown Keys.

If you want, I can generate a one-page “Keys and Depends_On companion” for the seed train and the 10–15 production drivers so you can paste it straight in. That keeps the model minimal while making it digitally fluent for your BioSTEAM/BOT stack.
