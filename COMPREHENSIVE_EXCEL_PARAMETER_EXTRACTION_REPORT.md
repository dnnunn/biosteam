## DETAILED COST STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### 1. TARGET COST VALIDATION ✓

**Target:** $1,264.34/kg
**Status:** CONFIRMED in 14 locations across worksheets

**Primary Location:** `Final Costs!B9`
- Description: "Cost per kg of product ($)"
- Context: Annual production cost calculation
- Formula link: Connected to total cost calculation

### 2. RESIN COST RECONCILIATION ✓

**Key Discovery:** The apparent discrepancy between $1000/L resin cost and $366,428/batch is explained by resin volume:

```
Calculation:
- Resin cost per batch: $366,428.57
- Resin cost per liter: $1,000/L
- Resin lifetime: 30 cycles
- Implied resin volume = $366,428 ÷ ($1,000/L ÷ 30 cycles) = 10,993L per batch
```

**Resin Parameters Found:**
- **Resin Cost:** $1,000/L (multiple locations confirmed)
- **Resin Lifetime:** 30 cycles (location: `Sensitivity analysis!K182`)
- **Protein Binding Capacity:** 60 g/L (location: `Inputs and Assumptions!B74`)
- **Product Recovery:** Calculated as binding efficiency × elution efficiency × losses

- What are the technology option dependencies?

### 2. **Buffer Cost Breakdown**
- What are the specific buffer volumes for each chromatography step?
- How are buffer costs allocated between wash, elution, and equilibration?
- Are buffer costs included in the $366,428 resin cost or separate?

### 3. **CMO Fee Model Variations**
- Are there different CMO fee structures modeled (greenfield vs brownfield)?
- How do campaign sizes affect unit economics?
- What triggers the various discount schedules?

### 4. **Scale Factor Dependencies**
- How do costs scale with production volume changes?
- Which parameters are scale-dependent vs fixed?
- What are the capacity constraints in the model?
